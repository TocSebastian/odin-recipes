    <h2>My favorite sports pub serves this, and I've come up with a simple and delicious home version.</h2>
    <p>Many local restaurants sell wing sauce, and most grocery stores carry it near the steak and BBQ sauces.</p>
    <p>It's rich, so serve in squares as an appetizer. Serve ranch dressing, celery, and carrot sticks on the side. Enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Cheeses</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place pizza crust on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Mix chicken and 3 tablespoons wing sauce together in a bowl until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 cup wing sauce on the pizza crust; top with blue cheese, chicken mixture, and celery. Cover pizza with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is cooked through and cheese is bubbling, about 12 minutes. Cool pizza about 5 minutes before cutting into squares.</li>
    </ol>
